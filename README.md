# n8n-chatbot-automation-orchestration
Chatbot-driven automation using n8n as an orchestration layer. This project demonstrates production-style workflows with health checks, async execution, retries, polling limits, and user-friendly notifications. Designed to reduce manual operations, improve reliability, and save engineering time while keeping execution decoupled from orchestration.
